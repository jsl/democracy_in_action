  <Subject>linking supporter to group thru API not reflected in admin interface</Subject>
  <Status>Accepted</Status>
  <Priority>Medium</Priority>
  <Body>when i link a supporter to a group using the api, either using the link=group|key, a la

http://api.demaction.org/dia/api/process.jsp?user=test&amp;password=test&amp;table=supporter&amp;Email=DIATest11181907%40radicaldesigns.org&amp;link=groups|26239

or trying to set a supporter_groups record directly, a la

http://api.demaction.org/dia/api/process.jsp?user=test&amp;password=test&amp;table=supporter_groups&amp;supporter_KEY=8336243&amp;groups_KEY=26239

i don't see the supporter listed as a member of the group in the manage groups interface.  what's more, when i use the api to download the supporter_groups table, i don't see any record of that association.  however, if i view the groups tab of the supporter record, it shows that the supporter is a member of that group and allows me to delete that relationship.

what's going on here?  besides wanting to be able to browse the members of a group no matter how they were added, i need to be able to tell if a subscribe worked or not thru the api.  is there any way of checking the membership of a supporter in a group thru the api?

thanks,
